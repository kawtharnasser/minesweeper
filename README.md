# Minesweeper

## Introduction

Minesweeper is a timeless strategic game that challenges players to navigate a grid filled with hidden "_mines_", The goal is to clear the board without detonating any mines.Throughout the game, players receive valuable clues, many tiles display numbers indicating how many mines are adjacent to them, helping to deduce safe moves. I chose to build Minesweeper for my project because it is one of my favorite games, and building it seemed challenging since it have many requirements.

### How To Play

1. Click on a square to reveal it. If it's a mine, you lose the game.
2. If the square is safe, it will display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square.
3. Use the numbers as clues to deduce where mines are located. For example, if a square shows "1", there is one mine in the adjacent squares.
4. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) to flag a square you suspect contains a mine.
5. Your goal is to reveal all non-mine squares without triggering any mines.

It handles the game logic, including adjacent cells, tile revealing, mine placement, and win/loss conditions. This makes the game interactive and responsive to user actions.

- **Version Control System(Git):** Git is used for version control, and source code management. Git helps keeping track of code changes, and collaborate on code. Which ensures that the project can be maintained and updated efficiently.

- **GitHub:** GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git to help developers manage and track changes in their code. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track revisions, and contribute to code from anywhere in the world.

## Next steps:

In the future I will improve this game by adding more themes (Cyberpunk Theme, Jurassic Theme, etc), and other customization features. I will improve the game interface and add better sound effects, and animations. In addition to challenging playing modes.
I will add a database to the game for the players to view their best score, and compete against players from around the world.
